    <!-- In HTML, various elements define sections of a document, each serving specific purposes for semantic meaning and layout. Here's a brief overview of common HTML elements and their uses:

The <div> element is a generic container used for grouping and styling content without semantic meaning.

The <header> element contains introductory content or navigational aids, usually at the top of a section or page.

The <main> element signifies the primary content of a document, excluding headers, footers, and sidebars.

The <footer> element appears at the bottom of a section or page, typically holding information like copyright notices or contact details.

The <section> element groups related content together, often with a heading, to divide a page into thematic areas.

The <article> element represents a self-contained piece of content, such as a blog post or news article, that can be distributed independently.

The <aside> element holds content tangentially related to the surrounding content, like sidebars or supplementary information.

The <nav> element is used to encapsulate navigation links and menus, making them easier to identify and use. -->

    <!-- Here is a typical layout of a webpage using some of these boxes (without content) -->
    <header>
      <!-- often a logo image will be in the header with the nav -->
      <nav></nav>
    </header>
    <main>
      <aside></aside>
      <div></div>
      <section>secton1</section>
      <section>section2</section>
      <section>section3</section>
      <section>section4</section>
      <section>section5</section>
    </main>
    <footer></footer>
  </body>
</html>

<!-- Notice how the header, main and footer are siblings (they are on the same level of indentation) where as elements such as section are 'children' of the main and the nav is a 'child' of the header -->
