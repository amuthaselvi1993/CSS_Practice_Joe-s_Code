For this task you will recreate the desktop-design.jpg picture in the design folder.

First, recreate the design in Figma so you can find out how many elements you will need and where you will place them.

Next, open VSCode and first write the HTML, followed by the CSS.

## Be sure to use FLEXBOX for the elements to the right of the image!

Use the included style-guide.md file to find colors, fonts and font-sizes.

Use the images in the images folder.
